# Forb-JsDelivr

## Overview

This project aims to function similarly to the renowned service jsDelivr. Leveraging Vue2, Vuex, and Vuetify, it grants access to npm packages. Unlike jsDelivr, this project uses the official npm API as jsDelivr lacks a search endpoint. 

## Features

- **Vue2 Framework:** Utilizes Vue2 for efficient and reactive user interfaces.
- **State Management with Vuex:** Employs Vuex for centralized state management within the application.
- **Vuetify Styling:** Implements Vuetify for a consistent and visually appealing design.

## Purpose

This repository is a playground for exploring ways to provide access to npm packages efficiently. Using Vue2, Vuex, and Vuetify, it demonstrates a user-friendly interface for interacting with the official npm API.
